is_extrapolated: 1 if the waveform data is extrapolated to infinite radius,
0 otherwise

r_scaled: 1 if the waveform data is scaled by extraction radius, 0
otherwise. In all cases where is_extrapolated!=0, r_scaled should be 1.

If the data has already been extrapolated then there is not extraction radius information.
If the data has NOT been extrapolated and we have a finite set of modes
corresponding to different extraction radii then the data is NOT scaled by the
extraction radius (is_rscaled = 0) and nrutils should know that it has to scale
the mode data by the corresponding extraction radius.
